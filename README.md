# OS1Pager: explaining open source software on one pager

There still exist situations where we have only a few
moments to explain what being open source software means 
and what its purpose is. 

Imagine - for example - you shall outline the main
ideas of open source software to one of your managers.
And you know: good managers want to get the information
as condensed as possible. Moreover, if we do not give them
what they need, they create their own summaries - which
might not meet what is really important.

The better way than not to give them what they want
is to give them what they want and what they need:
all necessary information on one page.

This project shall develop proposals which

* will be distributed under the terms of the CC BY 4.0
* explain the main aspects on exactly one page
